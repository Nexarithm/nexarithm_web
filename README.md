# Nexarithm's Personal Website

A minimalist digital playground where I share my thoughts on AI, technology, and random things. Built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, this site serves as my personal corner of the internet where I document my journey as an AI research engineer by day and indie hacker by night.
